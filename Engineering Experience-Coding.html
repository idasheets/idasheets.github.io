        <p>
            I wanted to talk about the coding I've learned. I currently know HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Pythong. However, I havn't done anything really meaningful with Python so this is all about my other language learnings, but I do know Python. This website was a challenge using JS, CSS, and HTML really pushed me to study, learn, and test my patience. Having to learn each language and them combine them took effort, fortunately though they weren't so complicated that I couldn't learn them at all. It took 4 months to really feel comfortable with them and be able to put together something that I'm proud of, and be able to say that I could replicate my work. As I've learned more and more coding I've realized how powerful AI really is in this industry, and not just for website building. I've been able to have AI do all sorts of things for me like build a task tracker. I realized that the best way to use AI is to understand the language and use AI to help boost your productivity, and that is exactly what I did.'
