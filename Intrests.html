            <p>I've been into rock climbing since freshman year of highschool, I absolutely love it. The joy I get from starting a climb and having to figure out a problem, which is what rockclimbing paths are called, is super fun. It's also a really great way to get a good exercise in. I remember the first time I ever went, the drive home was aweful and I hated it because I was so tired. In addition it's a great way to spend time with my friends. I have pretty active and athletic friends and it's really fun getting to do something that challenges all of us together and we have to solve something. While I don't think I'm insane at rock climbing I do love it a lot and want to continue to climb in the future. I have all my own gear and eventually want to make it out to the midwest to climb in the Rocky Mountains, or Joshua Tree National Park. For now though RockSport, ClimbNulu, and Red River Gorge will have to do.</p>

            <p>Magic The Gathering, I got into this game about a year ago and quickly have become addicted to it. I've probably spent around $650 on the game, and plan to spend more. The game to me is just facinateing as their's a million ways to play the game. In addition if you make a deck, you will almost never win the same way twice as even in your deck it's fastly different, and because of the nature of the way the game is played with other players each game is different. Here's an example of a game I won and how the game is so insane. It was me and 3 of my close friends Jonah, Jacob, and Jack. Jack was killed and Jonah had a huge boardstate, meaning the creatures and guys he controlled were really scary and he was most definately going to win. My boardstate was really small and I wasn't going to win. However, with only 3 creatures that I could use I managed to use one of them to sacrifice another, and that dealt damage to Jonah's health. This was enough to kill him. I never was going to break through all his creatures, but I didn't need to. The game is a puzzle and super fun.</p>

            <p>I'm absolutelly addicted to hiking as well. It's something I got into in 2021, when I went on my first backpacking trip, and now in 2025 I'm hooked. I have backpacking in The Grand Canyon, Appalacian Trail, Yosemite National Park, Zion National Park, and Josuah Tree National Park. It's just an amazing experience. Being in the wilderness for weeks at a time, no phones, no distractions, no issues, just you, your group, and nature. Camping under the stars is an amazing feeling. When you walk out of your tent and see the Milky Way Galaxy, it feels amazing. I wouldn't have it any other way. In addition it allows me to see places no one else gets to and spend tons of quality time with people that I don't normally get to spend time with.</p>

            <p>Something else I love to do is snowbaord. I've been snowboarding for around 3 years now, I have a brother who lives in Granby Colorado and I'll go visit him and snowboard with him. It's a blast of a time, extremely difficult, and super fun. In addition we are trying to work on building up our tricks, and practicing it. IT HURTS, oh my gosh. I landed on my butt when I went off a ramp and it took the fight outta me. We were practicing jumps after a day of hiking to the top of a slope, were already really tired, and we got layed out. So yea we finished up a bit early that day. However, we still practice as that's how you get better. Snowboard is a skill I'm super glad I picked up, and absolutely plan to continue it down the road.</p>

            <p>Last but not least I wanted to mention my family. I am extremely close with everyone in my family. My parernts have done a great job i;n raising us and creating a wonderful home and environment to grow up in. The thing I love the most is that they give all the glory to the Lord. We are a Christian family but my parents were not saved until they were mid to late 20's but they've still done a wonderful job. I am extremely blessed to have this family and the people I live with, their's nothign I wouldn't do for them.</p>

            Their are other things I love to do, like board games, skateboarding, movies, my friends, my family, but these are the things I wanted to share the most. I'm always looking to try something new as stepping out of your comfort zone is the best thing you can do for yourself and your character. Their are a lot of opprtunities that you miss when you hide away and never try anything unique or different. I've been blessed with an attitude of adventure, every day I'm trying to push myself and do something different and unique.
