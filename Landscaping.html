            Landscaping Experience
            <br /><br />
             I unfortunately didn't have any photos to add for this section so Ima keep it fairly short and sweet. I started landscaping when I was 12 years old and have been doing it ever since, so at the time of writing this it's been over 8.5 years. I do anything you can think of with landscaping, at one point in time I could have created a buisness out of it, and I thought about creating one. I was managing 4 or 5 different properties all with their own schedule and needs. I managed all of this myself, and kept track of payroll as well. This was the summer after my junior year and I could have expanded however I wanted to get my pilot's license and go to engineering school. Landscaping taught me how to handle long hours and hard work in the sun, I'm not a very big person and as such it helped toughen me up. It also taught me the value of a hard days worth of work and how to appreciate moments of calm.
