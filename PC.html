                <h2>This project was done a while ago but I'm forever gratful that I did it. One of my best friends had wanted me to build a computer for a while, and I finally said yes. I wanted to make it with a cheap budget but still learn a lot. Finding each piece was fairly easy and I got them all in within a month of deciding I wanted to build it. However, as is everything with electronics I very quickly ran into some issues. Putting the pc together was easy, ensure the CPU pins were in place, making sure each connection is put into the motherboard correctly, assemble the CPU fan and thermal paste, ensure that the HD+-, Power LED, and other tiny connections were intact. However when I booted up the computer, it wouldn't post, which is when the computer takes you into BIOS, which is the background of your computer. I fumbled around with it before asking a friend for advice. He quickly sumized that that CPU and motherbaord were not compatable, sick. I learned, after doing research, that if you choose an old motherboard, like I did, and a newer CPU, they are sometimes not compatable and won't work together. I fixed the issue by getting a new motherboard, and then I bent my CPU pins. Had to spend $80 to get a new one. Eventually I got it working and had to install windows, which was fairly easy. In addition my motherbaord did not have wifi or bluetooth capabilities, so I had to instal them myself. You gotta love building a pc. However, my computer is probably my favorite thing in my room, I do all my work, school, fun on there. I even created this website on that computer. It is the best thing I've built, but it forced me to problem solve and fix very frustrating issues.
