            I wanted to include a few quick notes about this website. This was created because I wanted to be able to show all of the experience I have in various fields, I also wanted to be a bit more personal with what I had as a resume is a very small look into my life. You actually get to know me and who I am by reading through this website. In addition I thought about using wix or square space but wanted to actually gain the experience of creating a website myself. So here are some facts about the website:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Over 1500 lines of code</li>
            <li>Over 10000 words</li>
            <li>143 pictures</li>
            <li>2 video files</li>
            <li>A PDF and Word document</li>
            <li>Javascript and CSS files</li>
            <li>Over 100 hours to complete</li>
            <li>1 broken desk</li>
            <li>1 almost smashed in monitor (coding is annoying at 3 am)</li>
            <li>Surprisingly no tears</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            I put my heart and soul into this website. In addition I also wanted to learn, grow, and show that in this website. What you'll see as you go through is when you start at engineering experience, the style is a bit normal, there's not a lot of background pictures, the photos are all different shapes and sizes, and it's not as organized. However, when you get more towards the bottom you'll see that there's a lot more style and organization. As I worked on this throughout the summer I improved my skills and spent more time learning. In addition I also wanted to show that I could learn entirely new styles, which means entirely new code, so most pages are not the same style. They might have different padding, different spacing, or different image slider designs.
