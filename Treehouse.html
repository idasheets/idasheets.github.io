                <h2>In the summer of 2025 I wanted to create a treehouse, however I didn't want it to be something lame, instead I decided to actually use my engineering skills and actually create a very cool treehouse. I wanted to have electricity, a zipline spanning across our entire field, a turncrank to bring stuff up, electricity, and be extremely high off of the ground. After struggling to figure out how high to make it I decided on 27 feet off of the ground, and that's where it currently stands. The treehouse is 10 ft wide, 25 ft long, and 27 feet off of the ground. It can have numerous people up there, a roof, and electricity. The biggest issue was hoisting the beams up. We had to hoist 250+ pounds of wood 27 ft in the air, and then hold it while I bolted them into the tree, not an easy task. With immense help from my older brother michael, our close friends the Dunlavies, and one of their girlfriends, we managed to get all of the wood up there. In addition we had to use a 4-wheeler to pull planks up to the top of the platform in order to nail them down. The mesh fence has not been created yet but will consist of a tightly woven rope and a thich wire running through it to keep it stable. The roof, which recently collapsed from a storm, is a plastic sheet with rope running through it and using heavy duty tape to keep it attached. The project would have been finished in the summer but our state decided to turn into a desert and I couldn't finish it just yet. This was one of my most ambitious projects and it's turned out amazing.</h2>
